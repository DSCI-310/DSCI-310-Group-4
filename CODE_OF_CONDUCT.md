YTt# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We, as contributors and maintainers, commit to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, handicap, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, degree of experience, nationality, personal appearance, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, in the aim of promoting an open and inclusive environment.

## Our Standards

We strive to:

* Be respectful
Disagreement is not a justification for bad behaviour. We collaborate to resolve conflicts, assume good intentions, and strive to act empathically. We don't let annoyance become a personal assault. 

* Take responsibility for our words and our actions
We all make errors from time to time, and when we do, we accept responsibility for them. We listen carefully and politely when someone has been damaged or insulted, and we endeavour to correct the situation.

* Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus
Disagreements, both social and technical, are common, but we don't let them fester and leave others unsure of the agreed-upon path. We want project members to address conflicts in a positive manner. 

* Ask for help when unsure
Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

Some Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Personal or political assaults, trolling, and insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for explaining the acceptable conduct standards and are expected to respond to any instances of inappropriate behaviour with appropriate and equitable remedial action.

If one member is unable to do their assigned tasks,  the team will confront one another about why they weren’t able to complete the given task, for a valid reason. The team will then work together to get the said task finished. If something like that happens repeatedly, the team will hold discussions and develop further action with all the group members.

## Scope

When a person is representing the project, this Code of Conduct applies both within project areas and in public settings. Using an official project e-mail address, publishing via an official social media account, or serving as an appointed representative at an online or offline event are all examples of representing a project.
